        <h1>About</h1>
        <h3>MY GOAL</h3>
        <p>
            My experiences as an industrial automation technician and PLC programmer 
            have taught me to make decisions in very aggressive environments and under a lot of pressure. 
            I also know the business world and customer relationships as well as the pressure to 
            achieve sales goals and the satisfaction of achieving them. I like challenges and 
            changes and I am used to them. Currently, I am looking to be part of a multidisciplinary 
            team of programmers, both server and client-side, where I can contribute my knowledge and, 
            at the same time, continue to grow and learn with my colleagues.
        </p>
        <h3>HOW I CAN HELP</h3>
        <p>
            By putting my professional experience, skills and knowledge at the service of the company in order to improve the relationship with its customers, its competitiveness and, ultimately, its bottom line. Whoever decides to hire me will have the certainty that they can count on someone who has been "trained" with the exact skills necessary to work as a team, who is passionate about what they do and who is committed to the company's goals.
        </p>
        <h3>MY SKILLS</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>
            Learning ability. I have the ability to learn new knowledge and the ability to constantly progress, listening and interacting with others. You're never too old to keep learning.
        </li>
        <li>
            Results-oriented. I enjoy the journey despite how hard and difficult it may be, as long as the journey leads us to where we want to go.
        </li>
        <li>
            Teamwork. I am a better professional when I surround myself with people who know more than I do.
        </li>
        <li>
            Analytical and problem-solving skills. I OBSERVE, that is, pay attention to the small details that are not immediately detected. I draw conclusions by using LOGIC. I use CREATIVITY to connect different concepts or realities that a priori have nothing in common.
        </li>
        <li>
            Response-Ability and perseverance. I respond "handily" to adverse circumstances. 90% of my achievements are based on persevering.
        </li>
       </ul>
